Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like windblown grass, a
field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification.
He sat beside Molly in filtered sunlight on the rim of a dry concrete
fountain, letting the endless stream of faces recapitulate the stages of his
life. First a child with hooded eyes, a street boy, hands relaxed and ready at
his sides; then a teenager, face smooth and cryptic beneath red glasses. Case
remembered fighting on a rooftop at seventeen, silent combat in the rose
glow of the dawn geodesics.
He shifted on the concrete, feeling it rough and cool through the thin black
denim. Nothing here like the electric dance of Ninsei. This was different
commerce, a different rhythm, in the smell of fast food and perfume and
fresh summer sweat.
With his deck waiting, back in the loft, an Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7.
They'd left the place littered with the abstract white forms of the foam
packing units, with crumpled plastic film and hundreds of tiny foam beads.
The Ono-Sendai; next year's most expensive Hosaka computer; a Sony
monitor; a dozen disks of corporate-grade ice; a Braun coffeemaker.
Armitage had only waited for Case's approval of each piece.
"Where'd he go?" Case had asked Molly.
"He likes hotels. Big ones. Near airports, if he can manage it. Let's go down
to the street." She'd zipped herself into an old surplus vest with a dozen
oddly shaped pockets and put on a huge pair of black plastic sunglasses that
completely covered her mirrored insets.
"You know about that toxin shit, before?" he asked her, by the fountain. She
shook her head. "You think it's true?"
"Maybe, maybe not. Works either way."
"You know any way I can find out?"
"No," she said, her right hand coming up to form the jive for silence. "That
kind of kink's too subtle to show up on a scan." Then her fingers moved
again: wait. "And you don't care that much anyway. I saw you stroking that
Sendai; man, it was pornographic." She laughed.
"So what's he got on you? How's he got the working girl kinked?"
"Professional pride, baby, that's all." And again the sign for silence. "We're
gonna get some breakfast, okay? Eggs, real bacon. Probably kill you, you
been eating that rebuilt Chiba krill for so long. Yeah, come on, we'll tube in
to Manhattan and get us a real breakfast."
Lifeless neon spelled out METRO HOLOGRAFIX in dusty capitals of
glass tubing. Case picked at a shred of bacon that had lodged between his
front teeth. He'd given up asking her where they were going and why; jabs
in the ribs and the sign for silence were all he'd gotten in reply. She talked
about the season's fashions, about sports, about a political scandal in
California he'd never heard of.
He looked around the deserted dead end street. A sheet of newsprint went
cartwheeling past the intersection. Freak winds in the East side; something
to do with convection, and an overlap in the domes. Case peered through
the window at the dead sign. Her Sprawl wasn't his Sprawl, he decided.
She'd led him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before, taking
care of business, usually with no more than a nod. Maintaining connections.
Something was moving in the shadows behind METRO HOLOGRAFIX.
The door was a sheet of corrugated roofing. In front of it, Molly's hands
flowed through an intricate sequence of jive that he couldn't follow. He
caught the sign for _cash,_ a thumb brushing the tip of the forefinger. The
door swung inward and she led him into the smell of dust. They stood in a
clearing, dense tangles of junk rising on either side to walls lined with
shelves of crumbling paperbacks. The junk looked like something that had
grown there, a fungus of twisted metal and plastic. He could pick out
individual objects, but then they seemed to blur back into the mass: the guts
of a television so old it was studded with the glass stumps of vacuum tubes,
a crumpled dish antenna, a brown fiber canister stuffed with corroded
lengths of alloy tubing. An enormous pile of old magazines had cascaded
into the open area, flesh of lost summers staring blindly up as he followed
her back through a narrow canyon of impacted scrap. He heard the door
close behind them. He didn't look back.
The tunnel ended with an ancient Army blanket tacked across a doorway.
White light flooded out as Molly ducked past it.
